Python Calculator

This is a simple calculator written in Python that can perform a variety of mathematical functions. It includes a matrix calculator, a linear equation solver, and a general calculator for basic arithmetic operations.

Features
Matrix calculator: Given a matrix in the form [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]], the matrix calculator will print the matrix, its determinant, inverse, transpose, mean, median, and standard deviation.
Linear equation solver: Given a coefficient matrix and a constant vector, the linear equation solver will solve the system of equations and print the solution.
Calculator: The calculator allows the user to enter any mathematical expression (e.g. 2 + 3, 4 * 5, 6 ** 2) and will evaluate and print the result.
